"""
ASGI entry point for StudentHub.

Replaces the default wsgi.py as the server gateway when running with
Daphne or Uvicorn. Routes incoming connections by protocol:

    HTTP      → Django URL router → DRF views  (same as before)
    WebSocket → JWTAuthMiddleware → ChatConsumer

wsgi.py can stay in the project — it is still used by some deployment
tools for the HTTP-only path.
